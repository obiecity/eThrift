# Welcome to eThrift

eThrift is an online marketplace for thrifted clothing. Below you will find a video describing the app in better detail. In the rest of this repo, you will find 8 total Python routes in the Flask API, as well as the Docker setup files. All files are commented, so the routes will have explanations above their code.
